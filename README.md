Metatranscriptomics Analysis of Early-Stage NSCLC

Assessing Microbial Activity from Total RNA-seq in Low-Biomass Tumor Tissue

This repository contains a computational pipeline designed to evaluate whether transcriptionally active microbial signals can be reliably detected in low-biomass lung tumor tissues using total RNA-seq data. Using two independent early-stage NSCLC cohorts, this workflow applies a contamination-aware metatranscriptomic processing strategy—including host read removal, quality control, taxonomic classification, and downstream ecological/statistical analyses.

Because tumor RNA-seq datasets are overwhelmingly dominated by human transcripts, distinguishing true microbial activity from technical noise is a major challenge. This pipeline therefore emphasizes:

Stringent bioinformatic filtering

Contamination-aware microbial classification

Reproducibility assessment across cohorts

Ecological diversity metrics and differential abundance testing

The goal of this work is not only to characterize potential microbial profiles, but also to highlight the methodological pitfalls of identifying low-abundance microbial signals in host-focused sequencing experiments. This repository provides a transparent and reproducible framework for researchers working with low-biomass tissues and contributes to ongoing discussions about the validity and interpretation of tumor microbiome studies.
