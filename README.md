# Metatranscriptomics Analysis of Early-Stage NSCLC

**Assessing Microbial Activity from Total RNA-seq in Low-Biomass Tumor Tissue**

---

## Description
This repository contains a computational pipeline designed to evaluate whether transcriptionally active microbial signals can be reliably detected in low-biomass lung tumor tissues using **total RNA-seq data**. Using two independent early-stage NSCLC cohorts, this workflow applies a **contamination-aware metatranscriptomic processing strategy**, including:

- Host read removal  
- Quality control  
- Taxonomic classification  
- Downstream ecological and statistical analyses  

Because tumor RNA-seq datasets are overwhelmingly dominated by human transcripts, distinguishing true microbial activity from technical noise is a major challenge. This pipeline emphasizes:

- **Stringent bioinformatic filtering**  
- **Contamination-aware microbial classification**  
- **Reproducibility assessment across cohorts**  
- **Ecological diversity metrics and differential abundance testing**

## Objective
The goal of this work is to:

1. Characterize potential microbial profiles in low-biomass tumor tissues.  
2. Highlight the methodological pitfalls of identifying low-abundance microbial signals in host-focused sequencing experiments.  
3. Provide a transparent and reproducible framework for researchers studying tumor microbiomes.
